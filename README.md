## Inspiration
Somebody once told me the arrows are gonna hit me  
I ain't the sharpest shooter in the field  
(The) game was looking kind of funny with the bow  
In the shape of a "D" that he wields

## What it does
Well the arrows start flying and they don't stop flying  
Straight through the gut and they got him crying  
Didn't make sense not to aim for the enemy  
Your eyes get sharp but your arms get numb  

## How I built it
So much to do, so much to code  
So what's wrong with using a pre-built engine?  
You'll never learn if you don't read the docs  
You'll never win if you don't do the talks  

## Chorus
Hey now, you're an all-star, get your code on, go array(s)!  
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get slayed  
And all that glitters is gold-plate  
Only shooting stars get the job  

## Challenges I ran into
It's a dark place and they say it gets darker  
You're getting tired now, wait till you get sorer  
But the team members beg you to slog  
Judging by the hole in the commit log  

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
The chair we sit is getting kinda sweaty  
The coffee's getting colder so you might as well chug  
My 'pits are on fire, how are yours?  
That's the way I like it, and I never get awake  

## Chorus
Hey now, you're an all-star, get your code on, go array(s)!  
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get slayed  
And all that glitters is gold-plate  
Only shooting stars get the job  

## What I learned
Somebody once asked could I learn anything from this project?  
I need to make this thing for my resume  
I said nope, what a joke  
I could do with an internship myself  

## What's next for tWANG
And we could all use a little help  
Well, the bugs are coming and they don't stop coming  
Started compiling and the game started crashing  
Didn't make sense not to run and cry  

## Leftovers
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb  
So much to do, so much to see  
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?  
You'll never know if you don't go (go!)  
You'll never shine if you don't glow  
Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play  
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid  
And all that glitters is gold  
Only shooting stars break the mold  
And all that glitters is gold  
Only shooting stars break the mold
